# Ceasar's Cipher Algorithm Read Me

## Description

Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.

## Example

s = There's-a-starman-waiting-in-the-sky
k = 3

The alphabet is rotated by 3, matching the mapping aboce.  The encrypted string is Wkhuh'v-d-dvwdupdq-zdlwlqj-lq-wkh-vnb

Note: The cipher only encryptes letters; symbols such as '-', remain unencrypted
